<h2>     
<div class="hover-title">As Heven, Breanna Box and Peter Dupont reinvigorated the art of glass blowing, and are now bringing their inventiveness to film, fashion, and beyond. </div>

<h3>   
<div class="hover-title">So you are both very busy individuals with a multitude of projects on the go outside of Heven. Breanna, you work as a director and a musician, Peter, you also have a clothing company. How do you manage to do glass blowing and work on everything else?</div>

<h4> 
[PD]: Sometimes we do not, I think you can only be in one place at a time and there are only so many hours in the day. We try to be focused on what we are doing at that moment. We were just in Minnesota shooting a film for Breanna. There are projects that move faster than others, and those are the ones you put the work into. The two of us can get bored quite easily and need to be stimulated in different ways. So, if we do not have a lot of different outlets, it is not going to work for us.

<h3>   
<div class="hover-title">Can you tell me about the other projects you are working on outside of Heven? You mentioned the film in Minnesota.</div>

[BB]: That is a documentary we have been trying to finish for a while.   [PD]: I think what is important to say is that the documentary is actually a part of Heven, as Heven is becoming more of a production company. We realized what we are good at with Heven is making a spectacle and making people say, "wow this is crazy!". With a current project we are working on alongside a well-known fashion house, we have been reflecting on what we are actually creating for them and it is not about the product, but the attention it will get. Same as the Coperni glass bags we did, yes they have been selling, but compared to how much noise they made, that is where the real value is for brands. We are moving into working on production, creative direction, short films and adverts as we have both really wanted to work in film.   [BB]: We were mostly inspired by Lucille Ball and Ricky Ricardo. They created their production company Desilu Productions.   [PD]: Heven is kind of a happy accident. It is great, I love it and I am so proud of it but, we have our creativity going in so many directions and this one just worked out.

<div class="hover-title">With focusing on production do you think you will eventually move away from making glass?</div>

<h4>  
[PD]: I do not think so. I love glass, it’s such a fun medium and there are not many people who work with it. There are craftsmen who do it in Venice but they make the same style of carafes and the same chandeliers that they have been doing for the past 50 years. The only innovation we are seeing in glass are the creatives who work with it and experiment, but just do not have the right outlets. The young creatives do not have as many resources and a lot of the people we work with in the studio make these amazing things that nobody gets to see!  [BB]: Also everything has costs; the glass, but also all the PR that we do with it. Adverts, etc.   [PD]: It is mad expensive!  [BB]: You have to pay your people, and that is not cheap. Even the advert we did where Iam eating cereal cost a few grand! All these things are very expensive, and most people probably do not think to put their money there. It makes sense to put the money back into the company where other people perhaps are trying to save and buy a house… one day we will get there.

<div class="hover-title">Did you expect Heven to become a company, did it start as a hobby?</div>

<h4>
[BB]: It started from an Instagram post.   [PD]: It was us doing something we both liked and enjoyed doing together. It was also something we were able to create immediately. A lot of things in our careers like modelling, creating shoes or fashion, can all take such a long time to develop, especially if you do it sustainably. Film too. It takes years to make it right and to see the final result. So what turned us onto glass was having something that we could do in the moment and immediately see the results. There is a satisfaction to that, especially when everything else is such a long process.

<h3>   
<div class="hover-title">So the immediacy of the work is what kept you returning to glass?</div>

<h4>    
[PD]: It is right in your hands, like you poke it and it has a reaction, it is not like film where you poke it and five years later you might see something!
